## Easy Install
`bash -c "$(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/circa10a/Device-Monitor-Dashboard/master/install.sh)"`
- Either Node.js or Apache and Python required for Easy Install
- Tested with Ubuntu 16.04 / Apache 2.4.18 / Node.js 4 / Python 2.7
- Follow the prompts!

## Usage
- Have a text file with hostnames or ip addresses (optional: if port and name are desired separate by comma. example: www.google.com, 80, Google. Custom name requires a port.)
- Update the python script (variable at the top) with the path/name of your file with hostnames and output file path.(default hostames= hostnames.txt   default output= index.html)
- Run `python report.py`
- Ensure that you place the output HTML file in the project directory so it can find its web dependencies

## Automation
- Setup a web server
- Install a new cron job to run the report periodically `cd $path/to/project_directory/ && python report.py &> /dev/null`
- Set output path in python script to write out html report to web serving directory such as `/var/www/html`
- The page will automatically refresh every 60 seconds to reflect the new report generated by cron

## Docker!
- `docker run -d -p 80:80 -v ~/path/to/your/hostnames.txt:/usr/share/nginx/html/hostnames.txt --name monitor circa10a/device-monitor-dashboard`

### Build your own docker image:
- `git clone https://github.com/circa10a/Device-Monitor-Dashboard.git`
- `cd Device-Monitor-Dashboard`   
- Edit your hostnames.txt file add your website, servers, switches, devices, etc.  
- `docker build -t myrepo/monitor .`  
- `docker run --name device-monitor -d -p 80:80 myrepo/monitor`
```diff
- Known issue: Docker for Mac pings any address and returns success giving false results.
